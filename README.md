# Thousand Years Gardening Manifesto

_Futures worth wanting cannot be developed, implemented or delivered. They can only be gardened, nurtured or cultivated._

Our age may well go down in history for its waking up to sustainability and its dependance on diversity. Today, the link between diversity and survival can no longer be ignored. In nature, loss of diversity is punished by the collapse of ecosystems, the extinction of species and the failure of immune response. In economy, failure to diversify leads to monopolies, market crashes, and outdated business models. Lack of diversity in political representation and popular opinion paves the way to intolerance, oppression and the many forms of discrimination.

Discrimination according to race, class and gender, in particular, teaches us bitter historical lessons about the role of language in the cultural loss of diversity. When a dominant system of values imposes its terminology on everyone, everyone loses out in the long run, often with disastrous consequences. We find it poignant today when we learn that oppressed are sometimes unable to even think for themselves in their own terms, let alone express their opinion and values. Only, rather than this being a historical malady, safely tucked away in the annals of time, it is much more likely that we lack the perspective to see ourselves unwittingly participating in modern forms of these same ancient disasters.

Software engineering suffused in a corporate culture worries about "development", "implementation", and "delivery". This is not the native language of engineering, or design, or data analysis, or quality assurance... These terms assume the necessity of "signing off" every investment of thought, time and effort and depict a unidirectional flow of "requirements" that largely coincides with the line of reporting and the directed graph of the org chart. When we then think of our daily work in these same terms, we find "signing off" to be the most natural fact of working life. 

At the same time, corporate culture celebrates creativity and innovation as predicates of agile adaption to the ever-faster changing horizon of opportunities and challenges. Only, businesses invariably find their investments in fostering a culture of innovation unsustainable, yielding short-term results at best. This should not be that surprising given the widespread and chronic loss of diversity brought about by the colonising top-down perspective, values and terminology. As before, everyone loses out.

"Dependency" is a charged yet ambivalent term in this language. It describes relationships between people as well as libraries of code and other contingencies. Dependency is a relationship we enter into because it is enabling, but it can always become a "blocker" for the same reason. And so, one must always trade independence at one level of organisation to gain independence at another. We need not look far for an example. When I type this capital "I" here, I depend on the entire history of computing machinery (and much, much more besides that) for this atom of self-expression to appear on screen. And I am grateful.

We may similarly think of the org chart as a dependency tree, bringing to mind a guardian-like relationship between line managers and their reports. Org chart according to line management is however only one view of a network of collegial relationships. We need different org charts for different purposes, such as those that cast project funding and departmental views on the organisation. In each case, we can associate a particular domain of expertise with a point of view, like that of a line manager or a stakeholder. We can extrapolate from this that many more useful org charts may be possible, each according to a different domain of expertise practiced within the organisation, each capturing some aspect of the rich reality of relationships between colleagues.

One or two of these points of view are so dominant, however, that no other org charts ever see the light of day. Because of this, some very real dependencies are seldom, if ever, recognised and thought about. Among the neglected dependencies, perhaps the most important ones are the ones that point in the opposite direction from the flow of "requirements". When we "require" a feature to be designed or built, we are in fact expressing a dependance on our colleagues to implement our ideas. 

Of course, the privileged few org chart types that we typically see are also the charts of privilege. They tend to closely reflect our ideas about career progression and contribution metrics. Yet, the higher we are on this career ladder, the greater the distance between our ideas and their real-world expression. And so, in the typical case, the underlying assumption that "signing off" is the only possible mode of organisation leads to loss of self-expression for all: Those that "require" cannot express their ideas themselves, and those that "implement" do not express their own ideas. This becomes ever more frustrating and depressing with each additional degree of separation between an idea and its expression.

Are there any alternatives? Are there feasible modes of organisation where one only ever sings off one's own work?

_Thousand Years is a sanctuary for the visions of sustainable corporate cultures where the purpose of typical work is to empower our colleagues to express their domains of expertise as independently as possible – especially from ourself. We thus celebrate diversity by preferring the majority of everybody over the majority of the mainstream._

Implement someone's requirements and you expressed their ideas for one day. Avail them of affordances to express their own ideas, and you free them for a lifetime. This simple motto yields a range of very desirable outcomes:

- Unprecedented velocity through decoupling and parallelism.
- Exponential growth of composable solutions.
- Ever-decreasing cost and risk of change and experimentation.
- Ever-increasing expertise across domains.
- Innovation everywhere and everywhen.
- Centres of excellence and talent magnets.

Pushing the analogy of a guardian a little further, we can also see how parenting provides us with the relevant "prior art" and an intuition about such alternative modes of organisation in the sense that the ultimate parental goal is the child's independence – especially from oneself. The parent thus works tirelessly to provide a developmental environment where the child can safely explore their own identity and become themselves, at their own pace, on their own terms.

Similarly, we believe that evangelising the values of diversity and innovation can be powerfully complemented by careful design of affordances that tip the scales of opportunities and risks in favour of nurturing diversity and innovation as an integral part of "the business as usual". 

Rather than software development, we focus on software gardening by designing tools specially adapted to the needs of different domains of expertise that prove irresistible to use because they empower the experts to get their job done with greater autonomy, expressivity and efficacy. Yet, by adopting and shaping these tools to their own ends, the users of our tools also allow the values of diversity and innovation to deeply inform their daily work.

These are some of our first projects, with many more to come:
